# Online courses Createx

The first joint project, chat @frontend_case_chat, has come to an end (:
In just over a week, the multi-page website "Online courses Createx" was created.
It's time to sum it up!

1) 13 developers took part in the project!
2) 250 commits were made, 25 pull requests were made, 20 branches were created and itâ€™s unclear how many conflicts in the code were resolved! ðŸ˜€
3) 10 pages were created and the beauty is that everyone wrote as best they could, as they were used to with their own tricks :)

Yes, of course, in many places there are jambs with adaptive, BUT in general the result is super cool!!!
Just imagine that everyone did their own piece, their own page, as they knew how, as they were used to. And then all this needs to be combined into a single mechanism. I think the guys got a good experience working at GitHub and more.
Iâ€™m glad that everyone who started making their own site didnâ€™t give up or merge, but brought the job to the end!

I would like to highlight people who especially distinguished themselves:
1) @stasholmansky and Alexandr - they made their own page and rushed to piece together the entire project, fixing endless bugs!
2) John Konan is a completely different story) The man who covered all the holes in our project! First he made the 404 page, then Contacts, then header and footer. Replacing people who were unable to eventually start doing their part and left the race!
3) All girls! It was a shock to me how cool they make layouts) Everyone, really everyone, has a good level of workbench!
